# Madison Slippi
Webpage to host slippi files recorded at Madison smash events, made to replicate Slippi.gg (sorry for ripping you guys off)

## Adding replays
To add replays, move your replay files into the replays folder and run include/py-scripts/replayerparser.py to add your files' data to the json map of the replays directory
(To do this, install python, add it to your path, run 'pip install py-slippi' to download the python slippi libraries for parsing game data, cd to py-scripts and run 'python replayparser.py') (or just add the files to the replays directory, make a pull request and @ me on discord @BigAndrew#7491)

In case of removing replays, install python and run mapcleanup.py the same way you run replayparser.py.
